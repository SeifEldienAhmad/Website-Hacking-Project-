# Website Hacking Project  

This repository documents my third internship project, which focused on **web application security**. The project balanced both offensive security testing and defensive mitigation strategies, providing a holistic view of real-world vulnerabilities.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore common web vulnerabilities.  
- Practice offensive penetration testing methods.  
- Learn and apply mitigation techniques for safer applications.  

---

## 🔎 Vulnerabilities Studied  
- **SQL Injection** – manipulating queries to extract or modify data.  
- **Command Injection** – leveraging unvalidated inputs to execute system commands.  
- **Login Bypassing** – exploiting weak authentication controls.  

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation Techniques  
- Implementing **parameterized SQL queries** to prevent injections.  
- Enforcing the **principle of least privilege** in online shells.  
- Reviewing and hardening **application/server configurations**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods  
- **Burp Suite** – intercepting and analyzing web traffic.  
- **SQLMap** – automated SQL injection testing.  
- Manual payloads and hands-on testing for deeper understanding.  

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways  
- Offensive skills help anticipate attacker behavior.  
- Defensive methods ensure stronger, more resilient systems.  
- A combined approach builds the mindset needed for **effective red teaming**.
